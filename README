Are you faster than a Chimp? Eg. Ai or... what's her son's name again? That's pretty impressive, but I don't buy this "cognitive tradeoff hypothesis."

This is a quick javascript implementation of a game similar to the chimp game featured on Vsauce [Mindfield EP1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqKdEhx-dD4)

Feel free to fork and do pull requests... :-) 

This was my first attempt at a javascript app, and purist that I am, I opted for "vanilla JS". It was also a great excercise in getting a javascript development environment set up - which took longer than the actual game... After spending about an hour trying to get Firefox working, and downloading Developer version, after finding dead links linked to from their latest version browser, I threw in the towel and went Chrome. 

TL;DR:
git clone the repo
Open Chrome
In the Chrome address bar, type: /usr/src/github/dagelf/mindfield (or wherever you cloned it to)
Press Shift+F5
In the debug pane, choose Sources.
In the left debug pane, choose "Filesystem"
Choose "Add folder to workspace"
Browse to the same path...
Whoohoo, you can now edit the source, reload, debug, step, trace, watch... everything you need to be a productive programmer.
