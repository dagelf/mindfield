## Introduction
Are you faster than a Chimp? Eg. Ai or... what's her son's name again? That's pretty impressive, but I don't buy this "cognitive tradeoff hypothesis."

Git clone it to your own PC and run it locally or [Try it here](http://mindfield.surge.sh/)

This is a quick javascript implementation of a game similar to the chimp game featured on Vsauce [Mindfield EP1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqKdEhx-dD4)

This was my first attempt at a javascript app, and purist that I am, I opted for "Vanilla JS". It was also a great excercise in getting a javascript development environment set up - which took longer than the actual game... After spending about an hour trying to get Firefox working, and downloading Developer version, after finding dead links linked to from their latest version browser, I threw in the towel and went Chrome. 

## Easiest Javascript coding environment
* git clone the repo
* Open Chrome
* In the Chrome address bar, type: /usr/src/github/dagelf/mindfield (or wherever you cloned it to)
* Press Shift+F5
* In the debug pane, choose Sources.
* In the left debug pane, choose "Filesystem"
* Choose "Add folder to workspace"
* Browse to the same path...

Whoohoo, you can now edit the source, reload, *debug, step, trace, watch*... everything you need to be a productive programmer. 

And I bet you'll beat my 1s record in no time.
